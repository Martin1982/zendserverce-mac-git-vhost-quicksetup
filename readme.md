This script will ask you for a short name and a Git repo location, with that info it'll try to handle the following stuff;
1. edit hosts file
2. add basic vhost
3. checkout stuff
4. restart apache

This took away most of my annoyances of starting a new project, if you require more;
Happy forking!


Pull requests will be reviewed, main goal: KISS!
